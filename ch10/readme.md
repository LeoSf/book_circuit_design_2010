# Ch10. Simulation with VHDL Testbenches

## Examples Index
* Example 10.1: Writing Values to a File
* Example 10.2: Reading Values from a File
* Example 10.3: Stimuli Generation
* Example 10.4: Type I Testbench for a Registered Mux
* Example 10.5: Type II Testbench for a Registered Mux
-- same as ex_10.4 but the project is configured for the post-implementation timing simulation
* Example 10.6: Type IV Testbench for a Registered Mux
* Example 10.7: Type IV Testbench with a Record Type
